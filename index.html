          <h2>I love to create joyful experiences with kind, creative people. I enjoy having thoughtful discussions, learning by doing, and solving meaningful problems.</h2>
          <p>After several years on the client experience side of a startup, I craved a greater challenge and began to teach myself to code. I spent over 1000 hours developing web applications in an intensive bootcamp environment. I learned not just Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, but also how to be an empathetic member and leader of a team, what it means to be Agile, and why design matters.</p>
          <p>I am looking for a front-end or full-stack role where I can continue to learn new things every day. I want to be a builder of beautiful software that improves people's lives. I want to make meaningful contributions that solve real problems. If this sounds good to you, get in touch.</p>

              <h2><a href="http://stuff-share.herokuapp.com/">StuffShare</a></h2>
              <p>I pitched StuffShare and was voted on by my peers to lead the team on this week-long project. I was the team lead, and was responsible for project management and planning (using Trello and Slack), schema and API design, search functionality and integration with Google Maps API, and overall project vision. StuffShare is a platform for people to share and borrow items and experiences with friends and neighbors. This is a single page AngularJS app built on Rails API deployed on Heroku that also uses Google Maps API, Postgresql, Amazon AWS, and Send Grid. </p>

              <h2><a href="https://github.com/samanthadrago/hyped">Hyped</a></h2>
              <p>My vision for Hyped was an app that lets users easily track, rate, and share movies, music, and books. With just a few short days to build it out, I decided on an MVP that allowed users to search for movies (using the Rotten Tomatoes API) to add to their watch list, favorite movies they enjoyed, and mark movies as watched. Needs some styling work. Ruby on Sinatra app using Rotten Tomatoes api, AJAX, jQuery, and JavaScript.</p>

              <p>During Dev Bootcamp, I kept a blog to share what I was learning. Posts cover everything from Ruby data structure basics to explorations of issues in the tech world.
